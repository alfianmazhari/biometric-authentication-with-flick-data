Biometric Mobile Authentication with Flick Data

This repository contains codes, some sample data, and result of my research on a novel mobile authentication method.

Mostly, people authenticate themselves to their phone using usual methods such as PIN, username and password, pattern, etc.
Unfortunately, those methods have weaknesses.
For example, when we input our PIN, username and password, or pattern, there might be someone behind us watching us.
Then, when we are not there, that guy may authenticate him/herself to our phone because he/she already knows about our authorization.
Therefore, we developed a new way of authentication using biometric data, which is flick data.

As we know, there are no 2 exact same people in the world, including their flick habits or style.
Therefore, if we use our very own flicking style to authenticate ourselves, then noone else can.

Thank you.

Best regards,
